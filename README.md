A project to shame myself into buying fewer games.


## Background
The gamer's ultimate problem: there are so many awesome games to play, and so little time.

The gamer can either:
1. Choose to enjoy the games they have now and not purchase the newest titles
2. Buy the newest titles and play them, while ignoring the games they already have
3. Buy the newest titles and add them to a backlog of games yet to be played (to suppress FOMO)

I want to do #1, but I end up doing #2 and #3. A lot.

As a result, I have a pretty big backlog of games across multiple platformsâ€”both paid and free.

This project is to help me quantify exactly how many games I have, which games I have barely touched, and which games I've put the most time into.
